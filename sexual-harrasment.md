# What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome or unwanted behavior of a sexual nature that violates someone's boundaries, creates a hostile environment, or interferes with their ability to work, learn, or participate in social activities. It can occur in various settings, such as workplaces, schools, public spaces, or online platforms. Some examples of behaviors that can constitute sexual harassment include:

* **Unwanted sexual advances**: Making explicit or implicit sexual propositions, requests for sexual favors, or pressuring someone for sexual activity against their will.

* **Verbal harassment**: Making derogatory comments, sexual jokes, sexual innuendos, or using sexually explicit language that creates a hostile or uncomfortable environment.

* **Non-consensual physical contact**: Touching, groping, or any form of physical contact without the individual's consent, even if it seems minor or accidental.

* **Unwanted visual attention**: Staring, leering, or making inappropriate gestures or facial expressions of a sexual nature that make someone feel uncomfortable or objectified.

* **Sexual intimidation**: Using power, authority, or influence to coerce or intimidate someone into sexual activities, such as threats of adverse consequences or job loss.

* **Displaying explicit materials**: Sharing or displaying sexually suggestive or explicit images, videos, or written content without consent, particularly in a professional or educational environment.

* **Cybersexual harassment**: Engaging in unwanted sexual advances, explicit messages, sexting, revenge porn, or online stalking through various digital platforms or social media.

* **Sexually explicit or offensive jokes**: Telling offensive jokes or stories of a sexual nature that contribute to a hostile or uncomfortable environment.


# What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
If you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of sexual harassment, it is important to take appropriate steps to address the situation and ensure your safety. Here are some actions you can consider taking:

* **Assertively communicate your boundaries**: If you feel comfortable doing so, clearly and firmly express to the person engaging in the behavior that their actions are unwelcome and inappropriate. Clearly state your boundaries and ask them to stop.

* **Document the incidents**: Keep a record of dates, times, locations, and descriptions of each incident. This documentation can be valuable if you decide to report the harassment later or if the behavior continues.

* **Seek support**: Talk to someone you trust, such as a friend, family member, or colleague, about the situation. Their support can provide emotional strength and help you decide on your next steps.

* **Report the harassment**: If you are comfortable doing so, report the incidents to the appropriate authority within your organization or institution. This could be a supervisor, human resources department, school administration, or any designated individual responsible for handling such complaints. Follow the established procedures for reporting and provide them with the documented evidence, if available.

* **Consult with a professional**: Seek advice from professionals who specialize in handling sexual harassment cases, such as lawyers or counselors. They can guide you on your legal rights, provide emotional support, and help you navigate the situation effectively.

* **Support fellow victims**: If you witness someone else experiencing sexual harassment, offer support and encourage them to report the incidents. Let them know they are not alone and that you are willing to assist them in seeking help.

* **Self-care**: Experiencing or witnessing sexual harassment can be distressing. Take care of yourself by practicing self-care techniques, such as engaging in activities that promote your well-being, seeking counseling or therapy, and surrounding yourself with a supportive network.
